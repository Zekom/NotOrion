# what ought to be refactored/changed?

move setup size and age default information into galaxy model
use non-pyglet image loader within nebula lobes model
use observer pattern on galaxy view, eg stars should be attaching to "set_scale"
move window.update into appropriate state/view
better separation/indirection between marker worm holes and wrapped objects?
	specifically, pulling worm hole color seems "wrong"
