# what ought to be refactored/changed?

move setup size and age default information into galaxy model
use non-pyglet image loader within nebula lobes model
use observer pattern on galaxy view, eg stars should be attaching to "set_scale"
in utilities random_dispersed_coordinates, ensure top/right are as densely populated as bottom/left
move window.update into appropriate state/view
set up logging on modules as described in http://docs.python.org/howto/logging.html
better separation/indirection between marker worm holes and wrapped objects?
	specifically, pulling worm hole color seems "wrong"
