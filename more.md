## What the heck is NotOrion?

Right now: it is (going to be) a galactic conquest game based on the 1996 game ["Master of Orion 2: Battle for Antares"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Orion_II:_Battle_at_Antares). 

Eventually: it will become [something more...](https://github.com/greenmoss/NotOrion/wiki/Version-3)

## Why should I care?

* you like strategy and "4x" games
* you like MoO2
* and you think it needs ["another cool feature"](https://github.com/greenmoss/NotOrion/wiki/Version-2)
* you prefer open-source
* you like indie games

## What kind of name is "NotOrion"?!

Yeah, I'm not so great with the names. So this is kind of a "placeholder" until I can think of something better.

## Open Source?

GPLv3, now and forever.

## I'm a game/coding geek; tell me more

I'm using [python](http://www.python.org) and [pyglet](http://www.pyglet.org/). Read the [code](http://github.com/greenmoss/NotOrion). That is all.

## This project is so cool! How can I talk to you?
