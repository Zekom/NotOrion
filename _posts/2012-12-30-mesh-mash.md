I have for the moment given up on unit tests for my Views and Controllers. The primary reason is the increased amount of time it takes to run unit tests with a GUI. My previous model-only tests took under one second. However my preliminary, incomplete tests for opening windows, activating the cursor, and updating screen graphics took at minimum 5 seconds. This may not sound like much now, but it would only increase in duration, and even 5 seconds is enough latency to discourage frequent testing.

I also was not entirely sure how to check for test "correctness" and was thus relying only on coverage. That is, if the test exercised all code and didn't crash, I had to consider it a passed test. This seems to me like a test of dubious value. So for now I've stowed these first attempts at "functional tests" (jargon correctness?) in a git branch and am continuing forward without them.

So then, on to the next task: displaying 3D stars, planets, asteroids, and gas giants in the star system detail view. I've created a basic 3D Mesh of an asteroid in [Blender](http://www.blender.org/) and exported it as .obj and .mtl files. Beyond that, I'm still confused about how to proceed. There's a "contrib" script [included in Pyglet](http://code.google.com/p/pyglet/source/browse/contrib/model/examples/obj_test.py?name=enhancements_1_2) which works with the example Pyglet .obj/.mtl files. However it only shows a blank screen when I tell it to display my exported asteroid files. To figure out how to make this work, I've created a [testing git repo](https://github.com/greenmoss/pyglet_obj_test). I'll be working on this and pushing anything I find to this repo. I've also [asked for help at Stack Exchange](http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/46528/why-is-my-obj-file-imported-into-pyglet-showing-a-blank-screen).
