I've been working on NotOrion code since at least Jan 18, 2011. That's what my first git commit says, although planning, reading and prototyping goes back many months/years before this. 

That said, where do I stand now?
 
I would have been months farther along, except that due to my inexperience I had to refactor *everything*. I have switched it all to MVC pattern, so I am now much happier with my code organization. This being done, I feel much more confident in my code's capacity for supporting new features.

I have a galaxy window with pan/zoom, and a minimap. I have a range display. I have generated named stars randomly, and their planets. I have a popup view for each star system which will display some eye-catching 3D sun, planet, gas giant, and asteroid views. I now have this site, so I can give periodic progress updates.

So what's next? Currently I am working on 3d meshes with Blender, and importing them into my game. This has been challenging since I've never used Blender before. So, now back to coding!
