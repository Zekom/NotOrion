Wow was that ever challenging. My first <a href="{{ BASE_PATH }}/galleries/2012/10/13/milestone-3">gallery</a> is done, but setting it up took two weeks.

The good news is that I was able to automate gallery creation so next time it will be much quicker. For any Jekyll Bootstrap users, <a href="https://github.com/greenmoss/NotOrion/blob/gh-pages/_rake/screenshots.rake">here's the rake task</a> I created to automate gallery and screenshot creation.

Next up: create a NotOrion python <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv">virtual env</a> so there will be something on github that is worth downloading.
