I picked up a cold last week, which interrupted my progress. I also went to [Surge 2012](http://omniti.com/surge2012) and met/heard from interesting people about interesting technology, but this also interfered with NotOrion. 

Project-wise, I've been working on "meta" items, especially tweaking this site so people can find my humble little project. I also still need to get my backups working properly again; my OS X upgrade plus Time Machine wrecked my previous off-site backups, which makes me nervous.

At the moment I'm trying to figure out how to automate screenshot uploads and thumbnail generation in GitHub pages (Jekyll + Bootstrap). I anticipate needing to create galleries of screenshots frequently, so I want this to be automated. Unfortunately, this has so far required a significant time investment, which I would otherwise be spending on game coding.
