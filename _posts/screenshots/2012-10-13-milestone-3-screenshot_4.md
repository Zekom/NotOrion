You can also zoom and pan in the galaxy map. Note the lower right map position indicator, which appears if any stars are offscreen. The nebula also appears larger the more you zoom in, though the stars and black holes remain at a constant size. 

One suggestions I've had for this view so far is to grow the star images a little as you zoom in. I'm not yet sure whether I will do that. The original MoO2 also had very small stars, but I had no trouble with them. <a href="http://www.shatters.net/celestia/">Celestia</a> also keeps stars as mere pinpricks until you get quite close to each star in relative cosmic terms.

Another suggestion was to have several layers of background stars that move relative to each other when you zoom. This would simulate parallax and add a nice 3D effect.
