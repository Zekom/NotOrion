{% include JB/setup %}

This shows the first of several setup screens for choosing the "universe" parameters, such as size and age. This setup screen can also be bypassed if you start up the application with command-line parameters. For example: "game.py --difficulty=Normal"

Not that it's relevant to game-play, but I'm using the pyglet <a href="http://code.google.com/p/kytten/">kytten library</a>. I may need to eventually replace it depending on how well it handles dense tables of information.
