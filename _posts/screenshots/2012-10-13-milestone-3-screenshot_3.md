Here is the same map, but showing range between two stars. To show range, you hold down the "shift" key. As your mouse cursor moves, the distance marker/label updates (eg "28 parsecs" in the screenshot).

Also note the green partial outlines around the origin and target stars. In the game, these rotate back and forth to indicate they are active.
