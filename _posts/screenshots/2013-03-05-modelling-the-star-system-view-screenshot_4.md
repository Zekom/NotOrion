<p>Here is the rendered view of a sample planetary system, again in Blender. I need to do more work on this scene before I'm ready to copy it into the game. For instance, I need to fix the precessing illumination on the planets. I'd also like to render some test gas giants and asteroid belts, empty orbits, and different star and light colors.</p>
