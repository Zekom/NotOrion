This document currently only contains hacks for me to get this code installed and working. Eventually it will become a respectable generalized document.

Pyglet on MacOSX currently requires 32-bit python. To force subsequent python modules to also install using 32-bit, compile them using ARCHFLAGS. For instance:

ARCHFLAGS='-arch i386' setup.py
